As of Fluidlogged API v3.0.0, the config is broken up into multiple files, and is stored in a new `./config/fluidlogged_api` folder.

Any data in your old config should have been converted automatically. But just in case, a copy of your old config exists as `./config/fluidlogged_api.cfg_old`.
WARNING: Do NOT change the suffix of the old config file back to `.cfg`! This will make fluidlogged api try to convert the file again, voiding any changes you may have made to the new config files since the previous conversion!

Once you've made sure all of your old settings have been transferred correctly, feel free to delete this README file and `./config/fluidlogged_api.cfg_old`!
