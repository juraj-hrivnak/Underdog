# The port number to use for the voice chat communication.
# Audio packets are always transmitted via the UDP protocol on the port number
# specified here, independently of other networking used for the game server.
# Set this to '-1' to use the same port number that is used by the Minecraft server.
# However, it is strongly recommended NOT to use the same port number because UDP on
# it is also used by default for the server query. Doing so may crash the server!
