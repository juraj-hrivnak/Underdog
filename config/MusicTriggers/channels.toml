# This mod does not create custom sound categories on it's own, but categories registered from other mods will still work.
# These are the normal categories: master, music, record, weather, block, hostile, neutral, player, ambient, voice
# Note that you can nest config files in folders by specifying the folder before it like folder/filename.
