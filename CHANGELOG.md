# Underdog Changelog

**Using** forge-14.23.5.2860

## What's new?

@news@{

- OptiFine *HD U G5* is now securely fetched from the official site via File Director.
- Fluidlogged API is now downloaded with `"launchwrapperTweakerForceNext": true`. This *might* or *might not* fix some of the start-up errors.
- Weather 2 Remastered's config option `Overcast Mode` is now set to `true`. This is done to ensure better compatibility with other mods and might be changed in the future.
- Disabled rain ruining the tanning process.
- Disabled DSurround's fog processing. (Fixed [#51](https://github.com/juraj-hrivnak/Underdog/issues/51))
