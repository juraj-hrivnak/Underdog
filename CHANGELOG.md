# Underdog Changelog

**Using** forge-14.23.5.2860

## What's new?

- Increased squid spawn rate. Their maximum spawn height is now 54.
- Reduced spawn rate and health of rats. They now only spawn underground (8 light levels).
- Rewritten scripts that used `replaceAllOcurences` (those that replace lumber) to Groovy. Fixes [#61](https://github.com/juraj-hrivnak/Underdog/issues/61).
- Added Pyrotech charcoal support. Fixes [#62](https://github.com/juraj-hrivnak/Underdog/issues/62).
- Other scripts are being slowly but surely rewritten to Groovy too. Sorry CraftTweaker, nothing personal.
- Disabled `missing_edge_chunks` config in VintageFix.
- Reduced fish spawn rate.
- Disabled Mo' Creatures' fox and goat.
- Disabled Elenai Dodge's tutorial.
- Debark textures are no longer missing.
