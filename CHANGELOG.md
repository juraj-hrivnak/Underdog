# Underdog Changelog

**Using** forge-14.23.5.2860

## What's new?

- Fixed errors in chat, caused by Tabulator.
- Removed Spice of Life: Carrot Edition because Nutrition already serves the function of mod encouraging to eat different foods, and with this, Scaling Health could be removed, which fixes [#64](https://github.com/juraj-hrivnak/Underdog/issues/64).
- Some tiny internal changes.
